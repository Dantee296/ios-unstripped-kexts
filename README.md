# iOS Unstripped Kernel Extensions, Kernels and SecureROM
These files are a great help when researching Apple firmware.  
Some of these files I dumped myself, others come from various sources on the internet.  
All of the code in the binaries is licensed and proprietary property of Apple and should never be reused without their consent.
